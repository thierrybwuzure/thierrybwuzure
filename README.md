Motivated career-changer building clean, responsive websites.
Currently in my 1st year of a Frontend Web Dev program at EFP,
while self-studying through freeCodeCamp and Udemy.

I'm training as a web developer to build e-commerce and web solutions specifically for
organic farms, producers, and retailers — a sector I know from the inside.

**Currently learning:** JavaScript(ES6+) · PHP · WordPress
